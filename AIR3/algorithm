Add the starting square(or node) to the open list

Repeat the following:
	A: Look for the lowest F cost square on the open list. This is the current square
	
	B: Switch it to the closed list
	
	C: For each of the 8 adjacent squares to the current square:
		
		If it is not walkable or is in the closed list then ignore it.
		
		Else:
			
			If it is not in the open list, add it to the open list. Make the current square the parent of this square. Record F,G,H costs of the square
			
			If it is in the open list already, check to see if this path to that square is better, using G cost as the measure. A lower G cost means that it is the better path. If so, change the parent of the square to the current square, and recalculate the G and F scores of the square. If you are keeping your open list sorted by F score, you need to resort the list to account for the change
			
	D: Stop when you:
		
		Add the target to the closed list, in which case the path has been found
		
		Failed to find the target square, and the open list is empty, in which case there is no path
		
Save the path. Working backwards from the target square, go from each square to its parent square until you reach the starting square. That is your path.
